# AirBNB-Capstone-Project
The Capstone project on Airbnb open data work using pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python involves analyzing Airbnb open data to identify patterns and trends in the Airbnb market. The project aims to develop a deeper understanding of how Airbnb is used by hosts and guests and explore the relationship between various factors, such as location, pricing, and listing characteristics.

The project may involve data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using Pandas, a Python data analysis library. Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used to create charts and graphs to help users interpret and understand the data.

The final product is an interactive dashboard or presentation that provides insights into the Airbnb market and the factors that impact it. The results can be used to inform Airbnb hosts and guests, as well as policymakers and regulators, to make data-driven decisions regarding the use of Airbnb.
